# Create a method that takes two integers as arguments. The first argument is a
# count, and the second is the first number of a sequence that your method will
# create. The method should return an Array that contains the same number of
# elements as the count argument, while the values of each element will be
# multiples of the starting number.
#
# You may assume that the count argument will always have a value of 0 or
# greater, while the starting number can be any integer value. If the count is
# 0, an empty list should be returned.
def sequence(count, num)
  Array.new(count, num).map.with_index{ |num, idx| num * (idx + 1) }

p sequence(5, 1)       # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

p sequence(3, 0)       # => [0, 0, 0]
p sequence(0, 1000000) # => []
